# Motor Speed Control

Use an Xbox Controller to set the speed of a single Neo motor with a PID controller and feedforward.

Run forward when the right trigger is held and backward when the left trigger is held.

PID and feedforward constants are adjustable from a dashboard.

In simulation mode a DCMotorSim is run to model the dynamics of the motor and controller.
